It's been quite some time since I moved from the Philppines to a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada. I like where I'm at now but it wasnt like this when I started my journey here. I was lonely, anxious and didn't have the confidence to talk to other people. Until one day I decided to suck it up, face my insecurities and decided to work at a local Tim Hortons.

First day on the job & I couldn't understand shit. I messed up a bunch of orders and customers kept on coming back to get their orders fixed. I know I was in trouble. This kept happening for a while and eventually I was able to learn how to listen and take orders properly. Weirdly enough I picked up phrases and things like:
* "How is it going?"
* Talking about the weather all the damn time.
* The phrase "Welcome to Tim Hortons, how can I help you." was stuck on my head

People at our local Timmies are very nice, especially the owners. I made lots of connections and met some of my life long friends while working there. Without this experience, I'd be nobody.
