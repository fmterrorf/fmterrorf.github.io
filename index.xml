One of the games we found was https://pyx-1.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/game.jsp which is a Cards Against Humanity clone written in Java. They did a really good job of implementing features like being able to pick card packs you want &amp;amp; in-game chat feature. The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s not mobile friendly so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to play it through the desktop view.</description></item><item><title>Moving to Canada &amp; Timmies</title><link>https://fmterrorf.github.io/posts/moving-to-canada-and-timmies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:15:20 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://fmterrorf.github.io/posts/moving-to-canada-and-timmies/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been quite some time since I moved from the Philippines to a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada. I like where I&amp;rsquo;m at now but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like this when I started my journey here. I was lonely, anxious and didn&amp;rsquo;t have the confidence to talk to other people (mostly because my English is incomprehensible). Until one day I decided to suck it up, face my insecurities and decided to work at a local Tim Hortons.</description></item><item><title>Keeping Terraform module sources up-to-date</title><link>https://fmterrorf.github.io/posts/keeping-tf-module-sources-uptodate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 13:41:25 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://fmterrorf.github.io/posts/keeping-tf-module-sources-uptodate/</guid><description>Few weeks ago, I decided to write a tool called drdrei that will automatically check if the module&amp;rsquo;s source attribute isn&amp;rsquo;t using the latest version. This tool only works if you have a mono repo that uses tag name format such as &amp;lt;feature_name&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;semver&amp;gt; for example:
gcs-1.0.1 gcs-1.0.2 gcs-1.0.3 And in your TF code you might have the following:
module &amp;#34;blahblah&amp;#34; { source = &amp;#34;git::https://example.com/monorepo.git?ref=gcs-v1.0.1&amp;#34; } You can run drdrei path/to/module and it will tell you to use use gcs-1.</description></item></channel></rss>
